# About Me:
Graduate in Computer Systems and Networks (SMR) based in Madrid, with 2,000 hours of technical training in hardware, networking, and Linux/Windows system and server administration. 

Completed a 250-hour Full Stack Web Development course and gained hands-on experience as a Web Development Intern at Redphone Services Seseña, developing WordPress websites, managing hosting on Hostinger, and providing IT support. 

I'm currently pursuing a Higher Degree in Web Application Development (DAW) to further strengthen full-stack development skills.
